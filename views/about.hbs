      <p>Eclipse Scout provides out-of-the-box solutions for your
        daily practice as software engineer. Scout applications
        are built on an abstract 'model', a straight concept that
        frees you from dealing with tedious technical details and let's you
        focus on the business logic instead. Based on that model,
        Scout renders a modern, responsive UI which works on any
        device.</p>
      <p>Eclipse Scout provides tools for all tiers, from the
        database to the UI. The following sections show you,
        which tools you get, when you develop with Scout. In case
        you miss something: Scout is also extensible. Simply add
        your favorite Java or JavaScript libraries.</p>

      <p>You don't have to be an UI expert, if you want to create
        a beautiful user interface with Scout. You just create a model of your
        application and Scout renders that model, using its modern, robust
        widget library. Check our <a href="/#demo-apps">Demo apps</a> to see Scout
        widgets in action. And if you are an expert: extend Scout with your
        favorite custom widget.</p>

      <p>Eclipse Scout applications are web applications, with or without a backend server.
       Scout applications are built with modern, standard tools: The Java
        part is built with Maven, JavaScript is built with npm and Webpack.</p>

      <p>At runtime Scout relies on the latest Java VMs and, for the frontend part,
        on HTML5, EcmaScript 6+ and CSS/LESS.</p>

      <p>Scout Java applications are deployed to standard Java EE web application
      servers like Jetty, Tomcat, Glassfish, etc.</p>

      <p>Applications built with Eclipse Scout come with a responsive user interface
      that adapts to any device. You don't need specific UI know-how to build a
      responsive application that runs on desktop computers, tablets and mobile phones -
      Scout does that for you and your users.</p>

      <p>System- and software architecture is the foundation for building stable and reliable
      business applications for hundreds or thousands of concurrent users. Eclipse Scout
      has done that for you already! The Scout architecture has been tried-and-tested in many
        successful enterprise business applications.</p>
      <p>Classic Scout applications come with a backend server, a UI server and a JavaScript
        client running in the browser. Eclipse Scout provides concepts, libraries and APIs
        for each tier.</p>

      <p>Eclipse Scout comes in two flavors.</p>

      <p>With the <em>Scout Classic</em> flavor, you develop
      primarily in Java. Based on your Scout model, the UI server creates a user interface,
      which runs in the browser. You may extend the UI by adding custom
      widgets, or tweak existing widgets by writing a bit of HTML5 and JavaScript code.</p>

      <p>With the <em>Scout JS</em> flavor, you develop primarily in JavaScript. You use the same
        model and concepts as a Java Scout programmer, but your entire application is written in
        JavaScript. That type of application may have no backend at all, or a backend with a
        Scout server providing REST methods, or a completely different backend written in PHP,
        .NET, node.js, etc.
