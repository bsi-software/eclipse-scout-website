      <p>Eclipse Scout provides out-of-the-box solutions for your daily practice as a software engineer.
        Scout applications are built on an abstract 'model', a straight concept that frees you from dealing
        with tedious technical details and lets you focus on the business logic instead. Based on that model,
        Scout renders a modern, responsive UI which works on any device.</p>

      <p>Eclipse Scout provides tools for all tiers, from database to UI. The following sections will show
        you the tools you get when programming in Scout. In case you miss something: Scout is also extensible.
        Simply add your favorite Java or JavaScript libraries.</p>

      <p>You don't have to be a UI expert, if you want to create a beautiful user interface with Scout.
        You just create a model of your application and Scout renders that model, using its modern, robust
        widget library. Check our <a href="/#demo-apps">Demo apps</a> to see Scout widgets in action. And
        if you are an expert: extend Scout with your favorite custom widget.</p>

      <p>Widgets highlights:
      <ul>
        <li>Powerful table</li>

      <p>Eclipse Scout applications are web applications with or without a back-end server.
       Scout applications are built with modern, standard tools: The Java
        part is built with Maven, JavaScript is built with npm and Webpack.</p>

      <p>At runtime, Scout relies on modern Java VMs and, for the front-end part,
        on HTML5, EcmaScript 6+ and CSS/LESS.</p>

      <p>Scout Java applications are deployed to standard Java EE web application
      servers like Jetty, Tomcat, Glassfish, etc.</p>

      <p>Applications built with Eclipse Scout come with a responsive user interface
        that adapts to any device. You don't need specific UI know-how to build a
        responsive application that runs on desktop computers, tablets and mobile phones -
        Scout does that for you and your users.</p>

      <p>In addition to providing a responsive user interface, Scout also makes sure the
        widgets are touch-capable. This means they are large enough to be tapped with a finger.
        Plus, they don’t depend on any pointing device feature, such as the right mouse button
        or a hover state. Still, they may use these features to improve the user experience on a regular
        desktop device.</p>

        applications.</p>

      <p>Classic Scout applications come with a back-end server, a UI server and a JavaScript client running
        in the browser. Eclipse Scout provides concepts, libraries and APIs for each tier.</p>

      <p>Eclipse Scout comes in two flavors.</p>

      <p>With the <em>Scout Classic</em> flavor you develop primarily in Java. Based on your Scout model,
        the UI server creates a user interface which runs in the browser. You may extend the UI by adding
        custom widgets or tweak existing widgets by writing a bit of HTML5 and JavaScript code.</p>

      <p>With the <em>Scout JS</em> flavor you develop primarily in JavaScript. You use the same model and
        concepts as a Java Scout programmer, but your entire application is written in JavaScript. That type
        of application may have no back end at all or a back end with a Scout server providing REST methods
        or a completely different back end written in PHP, .NET, node.js, etc.
